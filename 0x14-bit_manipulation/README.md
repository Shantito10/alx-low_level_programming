##Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Look for the right source of information without too much help
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

###Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

* Your code should use the Betty style
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
