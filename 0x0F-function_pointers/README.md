0X0F. C - Function pointers

#Resources
Read or watch:
* Function Pointer in C
* Pointers to functions
* Function Pointers in C / C++
* why pointers to functions?
* Everything you need to know about pointers in C

##Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

###Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
* A README.md file
* Your code should use the Betty style
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called function_pointers.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

####Tasks
* 0-print_name.c
A function that prints a name
* 1-array_iterator.c
A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array
* 2-int_index.c
A function that searches for an integer.
* 3-op_functions.c
Should contain 5 functions
* 3-get_op_func.c
Should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user
* 3-calc.h
Should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program
* 3-main.c
Should contain all the main functions only
* 100-main_opcodes.c
A programm that prints the opcodes of its own main function
