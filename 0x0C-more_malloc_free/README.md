#Resources
* Do l cast the result of the malloc?
man or help:
* exit (3)
* calloc
* realloc

##Learning Objective
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* How to use the exit function
* What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them

###Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
* A README.md file
* Your code should use the Betty style
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file

####Tasks
* 0-malloc_checked.c
A fuction that allocates memory using malloc.
* 1-string_nconcat.c
A function that concatenates two strings
* 2-calloc.c
A fuction that allocates memory for an array, using malloc
* 3-array_range.c
A function that creates an array of integers
* 100-realloc.c
