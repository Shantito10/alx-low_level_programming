0X0D. C - PREPROCESSOR

#Resources
Read or watch
* Understanding C program Compilation Process
* Object-line Macros
* Macro Arguments
* Pre Processor Directives in C
* The C Preprocessor
* Standard Predefined Macros
* include guard
* Common Predefined Macros

##Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What are macros and how to use them
* What are the most common predefined macros
* How to include guard your header files

###Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
* A README.md file
* Your code should use the Betty style
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

####Tasks
* 0-object_like_macro.h
Create a heade file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
* 1-pi.h
Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
* 2-main.c
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
* 3-function_like_macro.h
Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
* 4-sum.h
Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
