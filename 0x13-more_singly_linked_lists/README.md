#Resources

##Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* How to use linked lists
* Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

###Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
* A README.md file
* Your code should use the Betty style
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

####Tasks
* 0. Print list
Write a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.
* 1. List length
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.
* 2. Add node
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.
* 3. Add node at the end
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.
* 4. Free list
Write a function that frees a listint_t list.
* 5. Free
Write a function that frees a listint_t list.
* 6. Pop
Write a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head node’s data (n).
* 7. Get node at index
Write a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.
* 8. Sum list
Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.
* 9. Insert
Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
* 10. Delete at index
Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
* 11. Reverse list
Write a function that reverses a listint_t linked list.
* 12. Print (safe version)
Write a function that prints a listint_t linked list.
* 13. Free (safe version)
Write a function that frees a listint_t list.
* 14. Find the loop
Write a function that finds the loop in a linked list.
